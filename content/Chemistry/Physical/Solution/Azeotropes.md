# Azeotropes
- Are binary mixtures having the ==same composition in liquid and vapour phase.==
- Boils at a ==constant temperature==.
- Solutions showing a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">large negative deviation</mark> from [[Raoult's law]] forms a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">maximum boiling azeotrope</mark> at a specific composition.
- Solutions showing a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">large positive deviation</mark> from [[Raoult's law]] forms a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">minimum boiling azeotrope</mark> at a specific composition.
- ==Distillation can't separate both the components== completely from an azotropic mixture.
