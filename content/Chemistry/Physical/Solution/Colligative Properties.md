## Colligative Properties of Dilute [[Solutions]] 
==Colligative Properties==: Properties which depend on the number of solute particles(irrespective of their nature) relative to the total number of particles present in the solution.

The four important colligative properties are:
1. relative lowering of _vapour pressure_ of the solvent
2. depression of _freezing point_ of the solvent 
3. elevation of _boiling point_ of the solvent.
4. 
_osmotic pressure_ of the solution.
