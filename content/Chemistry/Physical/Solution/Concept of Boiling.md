- In case of ==large negative deviation from [[Raoult's law]]==, there is a minima in the VP vs. $\chi$ curve so there should be a maxima in the BP vs. $\chi$ curve.
- The point where vapour composition and liquid composition are the same, corresponds to formation of azeotrope and such azeotropes are called ==maximum boiling azeotropes==.
- ==Distillation cannot separate the two liquids== because the condensate has the same composition as the azeotropic liquid.
