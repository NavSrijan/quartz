# Elevation in Boiling Point
> Boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[Vapour Pressure]] of the liquid becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure.

	On addition of non-volative solute the [[Vapour Pressure]] of the solvent decreases and therefore, to boil the solution the required temeprature will be higher. So, there will be a _rise in the boiling point of the solution._ 

Increase in boiling point: $\Delta T_{b}$
$$\boxed{\Delta T_{b}=T_b-T_b^o}$$
where,
$T_{b}^{o}=\text{boiling point of pure solvent}$
$T_{b}=\text{boiling point of solution}$

> $K_{b}$ is defined as the elevation in boiling point when the molality of the solution is unity.

##### Expression:
$$\Delta T_{b}\propto \text{molality}$$
$$\boxed{\Delta T_{b}=K_{b}m}$$

> $K_{b}$ is called _Boiling Point Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic Constant)._
##### Determination of $K_{b}$
$$\boxed{K_{b}=\frac{R\times M_{1}\times T_{b}^{2}}{1000\times \Delta_{vap}H}}$$
where,
$R=\text{Gas constant, 8.314 J/K mol}$
$T_{f}=\text{Freezing temperature in K}$
$M_{1}=\text{Molar mass of solvent in Kg/mol}$
$\Delta_{vap}H=\text{Enthalpy of vapourisation of solvent in J/mol}$

### Formulas
$$\boxed{\Delta T_{b}=K_{b}\times \frac{w_{2}\times 1000}{M_{2}\times w_{1}}}$$
$w_2$ = mass of non-volatile solute
$M_2$ = molar mass of non-volatile solute 
$w_1$ = mass of the solvent
