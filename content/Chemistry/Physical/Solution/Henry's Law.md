# Henry's Law
Solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent increases in direct proportion to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution.

$$\boxed{\text{Pressure}\propto \text{Solubility}}$$

==Mathematically:== $$\boxed{P=K_{H}\chi}$$
Here, $K_H$ is the Henry's law constant, $\chi=$ mole fraction

Order of $K_H$ = $\text{He}>N_2>CO>O_2$
Solubility = $\text{He}<N_2<CO<O_2$

#### Applications of Henry's law
- To increase the solubility of $CO_2$ in soft drinks.
- To avoid bends, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium.
- Low blood oxygen at high altitudes causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.
#### Limitation of Henry's law
Henry's law is valid only for following conditions:
- When the pressure of gas is not too high.
- When the temperature is not too low.
- When the gas should not undergo any chemical reaction with the solvent.
- When the gas should not undergo dissociation in solution.
