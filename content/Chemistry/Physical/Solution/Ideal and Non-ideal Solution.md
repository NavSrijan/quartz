# Ideal solution
Solutions which obey [[Raoult's law]] over the entire range of [[Concentration]].
- Graph in case of ideal binary solutions.

- Intermolecular attractive forces: $A-A B-B A-B$
- $\Delta_{mix}H=0$
- $\Delta_{mix}V=0$
- $\Delta_{mix}S>0$
- $\Delta_{mix}G<0$
- Example: 
	- Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane,
	- Bromoethane and chloroethane
	- Benzene and toluene
- All these substances belong to the same homologous series and have comparable molecular mass.

# Non-ideal solution 
Solutions which does not obey [[Raoult's law]] over the entire range of [[Concentration]].
- Non-ideal solutions can show two types of behaviours.

## Non-ideal solution showing negative deviation from [[Raoult's law]] 
- ==Phenol + Aniline:== H-bond strength between phenol and aniline > Phenol-phenol or aniline-aniline
- ==Chloroform and acetone:== Chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule.

- ==Nitric acid and water==
- ==Acetic acid and water==
- ==Formic acid an water==
## Non-ideal solution showing positive deviation from [[Raoult's law]] 
- ==Ethanol and acetone:== In pure ethanol, molecule are H-bonded. On adding acetone, its breaks some of the H-bonds between them.
- ==Carbon disulphide and acetone:== Acetone is polar while $CS_2$ is non polar hence the interaction between them in the solution is weaker.
- ==Ethanol-water mixture==
- ==Ethanol-hexane mixture==
- ==Ethanol-cyclohexane mixture==
