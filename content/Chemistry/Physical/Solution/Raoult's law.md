# Raoult' Law
>For a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to their mole fraction in solution

## Miscible volatile liquids 
$$\boxed{P \propto \chi} \text{ or } \boxed{P=P^o\chi}$$
where $P^o$ is the vapour pressure of pure liquid.

For a solution having two liquids A and B,
A: $P_{A}=P_{A}^{o}\,\chi_{A}$
B: $P_{B}=P_{B}^{o}\,\chi_{B}$
According to Dalton's law of partial pressure, $P_{T}=P_A+P_{B}$
$$P_{T}=P_{A}^{o}\,\chi_{A}+P_{B}^{o}\,\chi_{B}$$
This can be written-
In terms of mole fraction of A as:
$$\boxed{P_{T}=P_{B}^{o}+(P_{A}^{o}-P_{B}^{o})\, \chi_{A}}\tag{Formula}$$
In terms of mole fraction of B:
$$\boxed{P_{T}=P_{A}^{o}+(P_{B}^{o}-P_{A}^{o})\, \chi_B}\tag{Formula}$$

Vapour phase contains both the components A and B,
Using Dalton's law:
$$\text{Mole fraction of a gas}=\frac{\text{Partial pressure}}{\text{Total pressure}}$$

$$\boxed{y_A=\frac{P_A}{P_T}=\frac{P_{A}^o\chi_{A}}{P_{A}^o\chi_{A}+P_{B}^o\chi_{B}}}$$
$$\boxed{y_B=\frac{P_B}{P_T}=\frac{P_{B}^o\chi_{B}}{P_{A}^o\chi_{A}+P_{B}^o\chi_{B}}}$$
$y_A$ & $y_B$ are [[Mole Fraction]] of A & B in vapour phase.

## Immiscible volatile liquids

$$P_{T}=P_A+P_B$$
$$Y_A=\frac{P_A}{P_{T}}\text{ and }Y_B=\frac{P_B}{P_T}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{Y_A}{Y_B}=\frac{P_A}{P_B}=\frac{n_A}{n_B}}$$

where, $Y_{A}\text{ and } Y_{B}$ are [[Mole Fraction]].

- Boiling pt. of this liquid mixture is less than individual boiling pt. of pure liquid.
- This process is used in purification of organic compounds.
## Non-volatile Solute
$P_{solute}=0$
$P_{solvent}=P_T=P_{solvent}^o\chi_{solvent}$

## Raoult's law as special case of [[Henry's Law]]
- In the solution of a gas in a liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas.
- According to the [[Henry's Law]], $P=K_H\chi$
- According to Raoult's law, $P=P^{o}\chi$
Thus, [[Raoult's law]] is a special case of [[Henry's Law]] if $\boxed{K_{H}=P^o}$
