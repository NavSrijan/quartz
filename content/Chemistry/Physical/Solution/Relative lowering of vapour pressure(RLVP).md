# RLVP
On addition of a non-volatile solute to a volatile solvent, its [[Vapour Pressure]] decreases.

Lowering of [[Vapour Pressure]] = $P_{1}^{o}-P_{1}$
Relative lowering of [[Vapour Pressure]] = $(\frac{P_{1}^{o}-P_{1}}{P_{1}^{o}})$

Formula:
$$P_1^o-P_1=P_1^o-x_1P_1^o$$
We expanded $P_1$ as $x_1P_1^o$
$$P_1^o-P_1=(1-x_1)P_1^o$$
As we know, $1-x_1=x_2$
Where, $x_{1}\text{ and } x_{2}$ are [[Mole Fraction]].
$$\boxed{\frac{P_1^o-P_1}{P_1^o}=x_2}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{P_1^o-P_1}{P_1}=\frac{n_2}{n_{1}}}\tag{Use for questions}$$
Quantity on the left hand side in the above eq. is not _RLVP_.
where,
$P_1^o=\text{Vapour Pressure of Solvent}$
$P_{1}=\text{Vapour Pressure of Solution}$
$n_2=\text{Moles of solute}$
$n_1=\text{Moles of Solvent}$

### Measurement of RLVP using _Ostwald-Walker Method_
In this method, a stream of dry air is bubbled successively through:
1. the _solution_
2. pure _solvent_
3. a reagent which can _absorb the vapour_ of the solvent. (if water then generally a dehydrating agent like anhydrous $CaCl_2$ is used.)

_$w_1$_ and _$w_2$_ represent the decrease in weight of the vessels and _$w_3$_ represents the increase in weight of the third vessel due to absorption.

$w_{1}\propto P_{SOLUTION}$ $\text{  }$ $w_{2}\propto P_{SOLVENT}-P_{SOLUTION}$
as the air was already saturated.
$w_{3}\propto P_{SOLVENT}$

Now, $$\boxed{RLVP=\frac{\text{Loss in mass of solvent}}{\text{Gain in mass of }CaCl_2}}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{P_{1}^{o}-P_{1}}{P_1}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{\text{Loss in mass of solvent}}{\text{Loss in mass of solution}}}$$
