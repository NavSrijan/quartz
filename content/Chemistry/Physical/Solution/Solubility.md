==Solubility== of a substance is its <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximum amount(Moles) that can be dissolved in a specified amount(Volume) of solvent at a specified temperature.</mark> 
- It is the concentration of solute in a saturated solution. : [[Molarity]]
>A solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two, or we may say ==like dissolves like==.

### Solubility of solid in a liquid
$$\text{Solute(s)}+\text{Solvent(l)}\rightleftharpoons \text{Solution(aq.)} ; \Delta_{sol}H$$
#### Effect of temperature:
Accoring to the Le Chatelier's principle - 
- If the dissolution is endothermic($\Delta_{sol}H>0$)- Temperature $\uparrow$, solubility $\downarrow$
- If the dissolution is exothermic($\Delta_{sol}H<0$)-Temperature $\downarrow$, solubility $\uparrow$
#### Effect of pressure:
Solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically ==remain unaffected== by changes in pressure.

### Solubility of gas in a liquid.
$$\text{Solute(s)}+\text{Solvent(l)}\rightleftharpoons \text{Solution(aq.)} ; \Delta_{sol}H=-ve$$
On increasing the pressure on a gas-liquid mixture at equilibrium:
- The gas concentration over the solution increases.
- Thus, according to the Le-Chatelier's principle, reaction shifts forward to dissolve more gas, i.e. solubility increases.
#### [[Henry's Law]] 
#### Effect of nature of gas on solubility
At a constant temperature, $\chi \propto (\frac{1}{K_H})$
$\boxed{\text{Solubility of gas} \propto (\frac{1}{K_H})}$

#### Effect of temperature on solubility
$$T\uparrow \,\Rightarrow K_{H}\uparrow \Rightarrow \text{solubility} \downarrow$$
