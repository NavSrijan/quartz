# Solutions
Solutions are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">homogeneous mixtures</mark> of two or more than two components.
>The term homogeneous mixture signifies that composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture.


**Solvent**:
- Generally, component that is present in the largest quantity ==(by mole)==.
- Determines the physical state in which solution exists.
**Solute**: Components present in the solution other than solvent.

## Types of Solution
### ==Classification of solution based on number of components present.==
| Solution Type | Number of components |
| ------------- |:--------------------:|
| Binary        |          2           |
| Ternary       |          3           |
| Quaternary    |          4           |
