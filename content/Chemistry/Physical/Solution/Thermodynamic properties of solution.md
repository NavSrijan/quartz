## Phase Diagrams
A single phase is represented by an area on a phase diagram.

- **The Red curve:** (vaporization curve) equilibrium b/w the liq. & vap. phase. 
- **The Green curve:** (sublimation curve) equilibrium b/w the solid & vap. phase.
- **The Blue curve:** (melting curve) equilibrium b/w the solid & liq. phase 
> Point T, where the three curves intersect, is the triple piont_, and here all three phases are in equilibrium.
