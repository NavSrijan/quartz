# Antilog
$$log_{10} a=b$$
$$a=Antilog(b) = 10^b$$
### Antilog of +ve value
Put everything before decimal point on power of 10 and find log of the number after the decimal point and multiply both of the quantities.
$$Antilog \ (2.3) = log 0.3 \times 10^2$$

### Antilog of -ve value
Put 10 raise to power minus one no. higher than the no. before decimal.
Subtract decimal value from 1 and find the value of which it is the log and multiply both of the quantities.
 $$Antilog \ (-2.3) = 5 \times 10^-3$$
 since $0.7 = log5$
