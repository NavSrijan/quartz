# Charge Distribution on an Isolated Conductor

Charge is distributed on the outer surface of the conductor in such a way that the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">surface charge density ($\sigma$ $C/m^2$) remain inversely proportional to the local radius of curvature</mark> of the body surface at any point.
At different points of the surface where radius of curvature is r, under isolated conductions the surface charge density is observed to be given as:
$$\sigma \propto \frac{1}{r}$$
