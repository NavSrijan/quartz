# Metals
When charge is supplied to a metallic body, due to its conducting behaviour, the charges within the volume of the body repel each other and spread outward till these all charges reach the outer surface of the body as shown in the figure .

Excess electrons are supplied to it to make it negatively charged. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inside the body volume these electrons repel each other and spread out till all these reach on the outer surface of the body where the charge distribution becomes stable.</mark> (Same case for +ve charge too.)

# Non-Metals
In case of a non-metal body as charges are not free to move within its volume, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the supplied charge whether positive or negative will remain within the volume of the body at the location where the charge is supplied</mark> by removal or addition of electrons to it.
