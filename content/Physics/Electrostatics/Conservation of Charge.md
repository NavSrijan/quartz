It is considered for an isolated system, the net [[Charge]] of the system is always constant.
==[[Charge]] can neither be created nor be destroyed and this is called '==<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Conservation of [[Charge]]</mark>=='.==

> In a mechanical system, the [[Charge]] on a body does not affect the inertial properties of the body. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">[[Charge]] does not depend on the reference frame</mark> from which a body and its different mechanical parameters are observed.
