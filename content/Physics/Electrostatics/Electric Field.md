# Electric Field
>It is an invisible region around a charge in which if any other charge enters, It experiences an electrostatic force of either attraction or repulsion.

>No charged particle experiences force due to its own electric field.

### [[Intensity of Electric Field]]
### Electric Force on Charges in Electric Field
$$\boxed{F=qE}$$
Where, E = Electric Field Strength or Intensity 
If the charge is negative only the direction will be different not the magnitude.

### [[Motion of Charge Particle in Electric Field]]
### Electric field due to a point [[Charge]] 
Let a charge +Q is placed in space and we have to find the electric field at a distance r from it.
$$E=\frac{F}{q_0}$$
$$F=\frac{KQq_0}{r^2}$$
$$\boxed{E=\frac{F}{q_0}=\frac{kQ}{r^2}}$$

### Direction of Electric Field due to a [[Charge]] 
- +ve source [[Charge]] 
Field lines always go away from a +ve source charge

- -ve source [[Charge]] 
Field lines always go towards a -ve source charge

### Effect of Electric Field on a Charged Particle 
1. If q is positive then $\vec{F}$ will be parallel to $\vec{E}$

1. If q is negative then $\vec{F}$ will be antiparallel to $\vec{E}$

### Electric filed due to a system of charges 
Electric field at a point due to a system of charges is the vector sum of the electric fields at the pint due to all the individual charges.

$$\vec{E}(P)=\vec{E_1}+\vec{E_2}+\vec{E_3}+\vec{E_4}$$
$$\Rightarrow\vec{E}(P)=\frac{kq_1}{r_{1p}^2}\hat{r_2}+\frac{kq_2}{r_{2p}^2}\hat{r_3}+\frac{kq_3}{r_{3p}^2}\hat{r_3}+\frac{kq_4}{r_{4p}^2}\hat{r_4}$$
$$\Rightarrow \vec{E}(P)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}(\frac{q_1}{r_{1p}^2}\hat{r_1}+\frac{q_2}{r_{2p}^2}\hat{r_2}+\frac{q_3}{r_{3p}^2}\hat{r_3}+\frac{q_4}{r_{4p}^2}\hat{r_4})$$
