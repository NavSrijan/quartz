# Electric Potential Energy
>It is the amount of energy stored between two charges when they are placed in the vicinity of each other.

Also,

>It is the amount of work done by external agent in bringing two charges close to each other from their initial separation of infinity.

$$W_{cons.}=-\Delta U=-W_{ext. agent}$$

$$\boxed{U=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}}$$

## Electrostatic Potential Energy of a system
1. _Interaction energy_ among all possible pairs of objects.
2. _Self Energy_ of objects of system.

### Interaction Energy
#### B/w a pair of charged particle 
$$\boxed{U_{r}=\frac{kq_{q}q_{2}}{r}}$$

$\Delta U=U_f-U-i$
$\Delta U=U-0$
Since, Potential Energy at infinity is 0.
Hence,
$$\boxed{\Delta U=U}$$

#### For a system of charged particles 
Write all possible pairs of charges and add their interaction energy.
_Number of Pairs_ = $\boxed{\frac{N(N-1)}{2}}$
