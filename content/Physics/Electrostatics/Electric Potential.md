# Electric Potential
> Electric Potential at a point P ($V_p$) is defined as the amount of work done by external agent per unit charge in bringing a charged particle (test charge) from infinity to point P without _changing the kinetic energy _ of the charged particle.

==Unit:== J/C (Volt(V))
==Scalar Quantity==
- Potential _decreases_ as we move in the direction of [[Electric Field]] and it _increases_ as we move against [[Electric Field]].
- On moving _perpendicular_ to [[Electric Field]], the _potential remains unchanged._
### Cases:
#### Case 1
	No other charged particle exists in Universe apart from the test charge.

$V_p$=0

#### Case 2
	One charged particle(+ve) is present.

$V_p$>0
#### Case 3
	One charged particle(-ve) is present.

$$W_{ext.}=\Delta U=U_p-U_\infty=\frac{KQq_{o}}{r}-0$$
$$V=\frac{W_ext.}{q_{o}}=\Delta \frac{U}{q_{o}}$$
$$\boxed{V=\frac{KQ}{r}}$$
Put Q with sign.
