## Axial Point

 Consider a small element of length _dl_ on the ring, and another element on the diametrically opposite end carrying a charge _dq_.
 We know from [[Intensity of Electric Field]]:
 $$E=\frac{kQ}{x^2}$$
 So,
 $$dE=\frac{k\,dq}{r^2}$$
 Since, distance between charges and the point = $\sqrt{R^2+x^2}$
 $$dE=\frac{k\,dq}{R^{2+x^{2}}}\tag{eq. 1}$$
 And, 
 $$cos (\alpha)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{R^2+x^{2}\tag{eq. 2}}}$$

$$E_{net}=\int{dE\, cos{\alpha}}$$
From _eq. 1_ & _eq. 2_:
$$=\int{\frac{k\, dq}{\sqrt{R^{2}+x^{2}}}\times \frac{x}{\sqrt{R^{2}+x^{2}}}}$$
Since only variable is _dq_,
$$E_{net}=\frac{kx}{(R^{2}+x^{2})^\frac{3}{2}}\int_{0}^{Q}{dq}$$
$$\boxed{E_{P}=\frac{kQx}{(R^{2}+x^{2})^\frac{3}{2}}}$$

### Notes 
1. $E_{axis}$ is zero at the centre of the ring and it again becomes zero as one moves to large distance from centre of ring, atatining a maxima once. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pazSToG.png)

2. The maxima is attained at $\boxed{x=\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}}$
This can be found evaluating $\frac{dE}{dx}=0$
