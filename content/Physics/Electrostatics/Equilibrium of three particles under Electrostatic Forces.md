# Equilibrium of three particles under Electrostatic Forces
![[Assets/Equilibrium of three particles under Electrostatic Forces]]
$q_{1}\text{ and } q_2$ must be of same sign and $q_3$ of opposite sign.
#### Conditions for equilibrium of three charge particles only under electrostatic forces
1. The charges must be collinear
2. The charges must not be of same sign 
3. The charges must not be of same magnitude 
4. The equilibrium in this situation will always be ==unstable==
	Why?
	For stable equilibrium restoring force is needed to bring particle back to its initial position
