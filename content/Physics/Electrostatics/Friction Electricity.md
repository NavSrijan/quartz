When two bodies of different materials are rubbed against each other, due to friction electrons from one body will get transferred to the other body which has more <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">electron affinity</mark> and due to transfer of these electrons, one body gets positively charged and other gets negatively charged. This process of charging bodies by friction <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">is called “Friction Electricity”</mark> .

By friction electricity only <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">non-metallic</mark> bodies can be charged as if metal bodies are rubbed against each other, some transfer of electrons my take place due to different materials but due to conductivity of both bodies in contact charges will flow back and neutralize each other that's why <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">metals cannot be charged by rubbing them.</mark> 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Two identical bodies having different charges will have different masses.</mark> This is because of the difference in number of electrons on the bodies, as these have different charges.
