### Intensity of Electric Field due to point Charge 
The Intensity of Electric Field at a point in space is defined as the force acting on a very small positive test charge $q_0$ placed at that point divided by the test [[Charge]] 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Test charge is always taken positive.</mark> 
$$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}$$
==Vector Quantity==
SI Unit: $NC^{-1}$
$[E]=[MLT^{-3}A^{-1}]$

$$F=\frac{Kq(+1)}{x^2}=\boxed{\frac{Kq}{x^2}}$$
If the position vector of point P from the location of charge is given as $\vec{x}$ then the electric filed vector at point P due to the charge is given as:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{Kq}{x^{3}}\vec{x}$$
