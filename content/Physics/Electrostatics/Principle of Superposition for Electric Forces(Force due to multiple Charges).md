# Principle of Superposition for Electric Forces(Force due to multiple Charges)
Force on any charge due to a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces on that charge due to the other charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of other charges. This is called the principle of superposition.

$$\vec{F_1}=\vec{F_{12}}+\vec{F_{13}}$$
$$\vec{F_{1}=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}^2}}\hat{r}_{12}+\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r_{13}^2}\hat{r}_{13}$$
For n charges,
$$\vec{F_1}+\vec{F_{13}}+...+\vec{F_n}$$
