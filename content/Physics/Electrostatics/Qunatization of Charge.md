The magnitude of [[Charge]] of electron is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">$e=1.6\times10^{-19}$</mark> C. (==elementary== or ==fundamental== charge.)

The magnitude of [[Charge]] of an object can be increased or decrased in steps of e only. This is called ==Quantization of Charge==.
$$\boxed{q=Ne \qquad (N \in I)}$$
