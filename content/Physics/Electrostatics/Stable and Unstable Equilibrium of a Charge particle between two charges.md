# Stable and Unstable Equilibrium of a Charge particle between two charges
Two equal magnitude charges of same sign are fixed at a given separation, and a third charge is placed exactly midway b/w the two charges.
### CASE-1: When middle charge is of same sign 
![[1.21(Physics).excalidraw]]
$$(a)$$
We can see that the middle charge on displacing along the bisector of the line joining the side charges, the force on $q_2$ due to both $q_1$ will push it away from the equilibrium position and we can state that at mid-point for displacement along the bisector of line joining the side charges middle charge is in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">unstable equilibrium</mark>.

$$F=\frac{Kq_{1}q_{2}}{(r^2+x^2)}$$

![[1.21b(Physics).excalidraw]]
$$(b)$$

$$\boxed{F_{1}=\frac{Kq_{1}q_2}{(r+x)^{2}}}\text{ and } \boxed{F_2=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{(r-x)^2}}$$
We can see that the middle charge when displaced along the line joining the two charges, the repulsive force on it due to the nearer charge is more than that due to the other side charge hence net force on it will be the restoring force which tend to bring it back to the equilibrium position, and we can state that at the mid-point for displacement along the line joining the side charges the middle charge is in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">stable equilibrium</mark>.

### CASE-2: When middle charge is of opposite sign 
![[1.22a(Physics).excalidraw]]
$$(a)$$

$$F=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r^2+x^2}$$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">STABLE Equilibrium </mark> 

![[1.22b(Physics).01.03.excalidraw]]
$$(b)$$

$$\boxed{F_{1}=\frac{Kq_{1}q_2}{(r-x)^{2}}}\text{ and } \boxed{F_2=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{(r+x)^2}}$$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">UNSTABLE Equilibrium </mark>
